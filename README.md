Why CSS Floats?
CSS floats are an older but fundamental CSS layout technique that allows elements to be positioned to the left or right within their parent container, enabling text and other content to wrap around them. Although newer layout methods like Flexbox and CSS Grid are now widely used for modern web design, understanding floats is still valuable for historical context and compatibility with legacy code.
